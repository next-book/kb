title: How to use this KB
---
This page should cover all conventions as a need for them emerges.

Every page can have a "howto" section where some contextual specifics are explained. (You can see it on the homepage.)

## Structure

There are three main categories of entries:

- **notes**: mainly minutes from meetings
- **topics**: info about a specific aspect gathered in one place
- **newsletter**: archive of mailings for a wider group of collaborators

## Editing

To edit, you need access to github repository [next-book/kb](https://github.com/next-book/kb). Request access from [Jan Martinek](https://github.com/jan-martinek).
