howto: (This is an example of a "howto" parameter content, see below.)

This knowledge base contains organized public info used by the next-book team. KB is for both information about next-book and its context.

This general "how to" page should cover all conventions as a need for them emerges. Every page can have a "howto" parameter where some contextual specifics are explained.

## Structure

There are three main categories of entries:

- **notes**: mainly minutes from meetings
- **topics**: info about a specific aspect gathered in one place
- **newsletter**: archive of mailings for a wider group of collaborators

## Editing

To edit, you need access to github repository [next-book/kb](https://github.com/next-book/kb). Request access from [Jan Martinek](https://github.com/jan-martinek).
