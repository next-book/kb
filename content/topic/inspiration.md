## Books

### Amaranth Borsuk: [The Book](http://www.t-h-e-b-o-o-k.com) 

Book described as object, content, idea, and interface. Object/content divide describes how older formats evolved into a codex format that is used nowadays — important knowledge when thinking about transitioning into digital. (Honza has Kindle edition.)

### Susan Hawthorne: [Bibliodiversity: A Manifesto for Independent Publishing](http://www.spinifexpress.com.au/Bookstore/book/id=269/) 

Interesting essay about the role of small publishers, framed by [systems thinking](http://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-book-sale/), social justice, feminism and market transitions of the 80s (big publishing houses) and 00s (Amazon.com). (Honza has paper edition in Czech.)

## Papers and articles

### Anne Mangen, Adriaan van der Weel: [The evolution of reading in the age of digitisation: An integrative framework for reading research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294633606_The_evolution_of_reading_in_the_age_of_digitisation_An_integrative_framework_for_reading_research)

Paper developing a framework for reading research. (Full text available online.) 

> The framework defines reading along the following dimensions:
> 
> - **Ergonomic dimension**: reading is a physical, multisensory engagement with a device;
> - **Attentional/perceptual dimension**: reading is allocation of attentional resources; perceptual processing;
> - **Cognitive dimension**: reading is cognitive, linguistic processing;
> - **Emotional dimension**: reading is, potentially, an emotionally impactful experience;
> - **Phenomenological dimension**: reading is a personally meaningful activity;
> - **Sociocultural dimension**: reading is a socioculturally (and ideologically) appraised and historically contingent activity with sociocultural implications;
> - **Cultural–evolutionary dimension**: reading is an exocerebral extension of the brain (Bartra, 2014) developed under pressure of the increasing informational demands of an ever more sophisticated cultural habitat.
