# Intro and expectations

### Expectations

- LukÃ¡Å¡: I still donâ€™t know, what I donâ€™t know: whatâ€™s needed, what are the goals? (funding, marketing, sales, evangelization, problem/solution verification?)
- MatÄ›j: what is a digital text? unsure whatâ€™s possible in the context of next-book
- Honza: building a healthy and sustainable work env, introing others into a project, needs a lot of idea verification

### Roles

- Josef: research, documentation, no coding
- LukÃ¡Å¡: marketing, user testing, self-publishing outreach
- MatÄ›j: presentation layer, finding visual design for a digital book (part of my dissertation)
